How to Use:

Download the HTML and CSS files.
Replace placeholder content (such as cricketer's name, image URL, stats, and description) with the actual information for the desired player.
Customize styles as needed to align with the overall design aesthetic of the website.
Note:
This project serves as a foundation for creating dynamic cricketer profiles on a sports website or any platform focused on cricket enthusiasts. Developers can further enhance the project by incorporating interactive features, additional statistics, and links to the cricketer's social media profiles.
